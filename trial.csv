ChatGPT:
You can incorporate user information into your embeddings by using a technique called feature concatenation. Here‚Äôs a general idea of how you can do it:

User ID Encoding: Assign a unique ID to each user and use one-hot encoding or an embedding layer to convert these IDs into fixed-length vectors. This will allow your model to learn and understand user-specific characteristics.
Concatenation: After you have both the message embeddings (from Sentence Transformer) and user embeddings (from User ID Encoding), you can concatenate these two vectors to form a new input vector. This new vector now contains information from both the message and the user.",2024-03-29 11:24:50+00:00,"MessageReactions(results=[], min=False, can_see_list=True, reactions_as_tags=False, recent_reactions=[])"

We had a meeting with PoliNetwork associates this week, they gave us an unofficial approval, but they said they have to talk back with the association's board and will give us the feedback.

For now we have started testing methods that you sent us (Laser Embedding and sentence transformer).

Also, we have implemented the script in which we are going to use¬†to gather the data.

As for the next steps for the coming days we plan to work on the data gathering pipeline and the preprocessing stage, As well as reading more about the the embedding techniques and the best approach we can take for detecting the change of topic in a conversation.
